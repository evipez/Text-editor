This is my first react project.

I've experimented a lot and I'm pretty sure that there would have been better solutions in some cases but anyway take a look



HOW TO USE

To be able to use this project, you need to setup a backend, a local JSON RestAPI.
Follow the steps here: https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/create-a-rest-api-with-json-server-36da8680136d

After the installation you need to start the JSON Rest API on the port 3000 and the React Project on the port 3001.
